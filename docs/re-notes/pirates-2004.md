# Sid Meier's Pirates! (2004)

`test/binaries/candidates/pirates-2004/digital/app/Pirates!.exe`, registry id
`pirates_2004` (`d3d9Programmable`, `bigMemory`). Direct3D 9, statically linked
(`d3d9.dll` import), with msvcr71/msvcp71, Bink, Miles (mss32 plus its
`win32/*.asi`, `*.m3d`, `*.flt` providers) and oleaut32 from the game directory.

## Route to the main menu (CLI, software D3D9 arm)

```sh
node test/run.js --app=pirates_2004 --d3d9-renderer=software --batch-size=100000 \
  --max-batches=1000000 --max-seconds=180 --stuck-after=1000000 --no-close --png=menu.png
```

The D3D9 main menu (Play Sid Meier's Pirates!, Load A Game, Change Your System
Options, Visit The Firaxis Website, Visit The Hall Of Champions, View Credits,
Quit, over the Caribbean map) is up by batch ~1000 at `--batch-size=100000`.
Assets load from `assets\pak*.fpk` one byte per `ReadFile`, which is slow but
correct. Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261006T033534Z-pirates_2004-dxinit`.

## Startup, as reverse engineered (2026-10-06)

- `0x4d2950` is graphics init. It calls `0x500080` (device setup); a nonzero
  result goes to an error path that first asks the DxDiag provider for the
  DirectX version (`0x4ad050`, through the game's `dxdiagn.dll` COM server)
  **only to choose the message**: below 9.0c (`0x90003`) it shows the
  "requires DirectX 9.0c" text at `0x70e234`, otherwise "Unable to initialize
  DirectX." So that message never means the DirectX version check failed.
- Device setup creates a HAL device with software vertex processing
  (BehaviorFlags `0x24`), reads the render target, depth surface and
  `GetDeviceCaps`, and at `0x5c0963` requires `MaxTextureBlendStages >= 2` and
  `MaxSimultaneousTextures >= 2`. Its caps record is at `this+0x644`; it also
  reads MaxVertexBlendMatrices (`+0xa8`), MaxStreams, and the vertex/pixel
  shader versions (`+0xc4`/`+0xcc`; the helper at `0x5002f0` returns them as
  major*10+minor to about twenty callers).
- Miles' A3D provider `win32\mssa3d.m3d` asks `CoCreateInstance` for
  Aureal's class (`a3dapi.dll`), which no machine without an A3D card has.

## Fixed

| commit | what |
|---|---|
| `ba161dfb` | D3D9 caps advertise `MaxTextureBlendStages = 6` (was 0) |
| `12408feb` | a `CoCreateInstance` whose in-proc DLL is missing resumes the caller (the yield pump left EIP on the thunk and re-ran it on the caller stack) and clears `*ppv` |
| `d7f5a429` | `test/run.js` honours `bigMemory` (2048 MB); at 512 MB the asset load runs out of guest heap |

## Not yet looked at

Gameplay (`Play Sid Meier's Pirates!`), audio, the WebGL arm at this build.
`ole32.dll` is absent from this box's `test/binaries/dlls`, so the Miles
providers' ole32 imports fall to WAT stubs.

## TG77 cooperative thread attach (2026-10-14, unresolved)

Safari reported `DllMain did not complete` for module `0x9f1000`, reason 2,
with restored caller EIP `0x9fc4bb`. Chrome cooperative evidence supplied by
the runtime investigator (`scratch/runs/20261014-pirates-browser-cooperative`)
places the actual msvcr71.dll callback at `0x7503fc0`, yield 9 / halt 4:
a critical-section wait. The section owner remains to be captured.

Source inspection and the cheap `node tools/pirates-attach-gap.js` witness
confirm that the synchronous callback runner restores the caller and releases
the callback gate on this wait; retrying the notification repeats previously
completed DLL callbacks. This mock reproduction is not real-PE acceptance.
See [continuation interface and regression plan](../pirates-attach-continuation-plan-20261014.txt)
for the required owning-thread scheduler integration, cleanup contracts and
unexecuted real-PE/browser gates. No production fix is included.

## Cooperative thread-attach regression (2026-10-14, TG77)

The Safari report on module SHA256
`e6ac188dd8c7b16d04eaa4b74446ab2c4ab211422738709e33cffda5db444e7e`
reports `DllMain did not complete: module=0x9f1000 reason=2`.
Reproduced with the existing pinned corpus acquisition on temporary
`bx_tgbme2h7`, Chrome, isolated page, `?debug&no-threads&app=pirates_2004`.
Source was `43f04c7c4ac8914c385c37a7be96c7e1b9f61623`, same module hash.
No guest patch, capability override, or DllMain completion bypass was used.

The loader identifies `0x9f1000` as **msvcr71.dll**, preferred base
`0x7c340000`, entry `0x9f329f`. Several prior callbacks complete normally.
The failing callback stops at `EIP=0x7503fc0 yield=9 halt=4`: a critical-section
wait, not the callback budget limit. The later crash report's `0x9fc5ec`
(Safari reported `0x9fc4bb`) is the restored caller state, not that wait thunk.
Increasing budgets or marking the unfinished attach complete would hide the
scheduling problem.

Next capture the contended section and its owner, then implement resumable
thread-attach scheduling with a real contended-lock regression. Preserve the
callback frame, loader serialization, and exactly-once notifications while
allowing the owner to run. `pumpThreadsOnce` deliberately refuses entry while
already running a cooperative worker, so it is not a drop-in fix here.
The owner and precise lock have not yet been established. Worker-mode and
Safari retests remain separate; no fix or gameplay acceptance is claimed.

Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261014-pirates-browser-cooperative/` contains the
90-second probe, six captures/state snapshots, browser log and process receipt.
The final fatal-error screenshot was reviewed. The original user report is in
`scratch/runs/20261014-pirates-user-crash/report.txt`.
